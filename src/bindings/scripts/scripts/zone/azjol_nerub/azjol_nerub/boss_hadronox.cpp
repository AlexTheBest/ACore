//Phase 0 => Gauntlet Event described below
//Phase 1 => Boss Encounter

/*When your group enters the main room (the one after the bridge), you will notice a group of 3 Nerubians. 
When you engage them, 2 more groups like this one spawn behind the first one - it is important to pull the first group back, 
so you don't aggro all 3. Hadronox will be under you, fighting Nerubians.

This is the timed gauntlet - waves of non-elite spiders
 will spawn from the 3 doors located a little above the main room, and will then head down to fight Hadronox. After clearing the
 main room, it is recommended to just stay in it, kill the occasional non-elites that will attack you instead of the boss, and wait for
 Hadronox to make his way to you. When Hadronox enters the main room, she will web the doors, and no more non-elites will spawn.*/
