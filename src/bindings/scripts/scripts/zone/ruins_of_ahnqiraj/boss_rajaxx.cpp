//Rajaxx
//8603 Attack and make them pay dearly!
//8604 Breath your last!
//8605 Crush them! Drive them out!
//8606 Do not hesitate! Destroy them!
//8613 Warriors! Captians! Continue the fight...
//8614 You are not worth my time $N!
//8612 The time of our retribution is at hand! Let darkness reign in the hearts of our enemies!
//8610 No longer will we wait behind barred doors and walls of stone! No longer will our vengeance be denied! The dragons themselves will tremble before our wrath!
//8608 Fear is for the enemy! Fear and death!
//8611 Staghelm will whimper and beg for his life, just as his whelp of a son did! One thousand years of injustice will end this day!
//8607 Fandral! Your time has come! Go and hide in the Emerald Dream and pray we never find you!
//8609 Impudent fool! I will kill you myself!

//Andorov - no sound
//"Remember, Rajaxx, when I said I'd kill you last? I lied..."
//"They come now. Try not to get yourself killed, young blood."
