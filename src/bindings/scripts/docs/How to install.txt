--- How to install ScriptDev2 ---

1) Download MaNGOS
2) Create a new folder under "src\bindings\" within the MaNGOS source called "ScriptDev2"
3) Checkout the ScriptDev2 trunk from "https://scriptdev2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scriptdev2"

4a) On Win32: 
 - Compile MaNGOS
 - Compile ScriptDev2 using the ScriptVC70, ScriptVC80, or ScriptVC90 Solution within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

4b) On Linux: 
- Apply MaNGOS-rXXXX-ScriptDev2.patch, where XXXX is the highest version to that of your MaNGOS revision, to Mangos Source
- Compile MaNGOS (ScriptDev2 will automatically be built when compiling Mangos from here on)

5) Create the default ScriptDev2 database using "sql\created_database.sql", then execute "sql\scriptdev2_structure.sql" on that database.

6) Execute the included "sql\mangos_full_scripts.sql" on your MaNGOS database.

7) Place the included "scriptdev2.conf" file within the directory containing your "mangosd.conf" and "realmd.conf" files. You may need to change this file to match the database you created and any custom settings you wish to use (such as a different locale).

8) Run mangosd from your output directory


To update ScriptDev2: 
All you have to do is open src\bindings\ and right click on the ScriptDev2 folder and click "Update" and then follow steps 4, 6, 7, and 8 again. You must still compile MaNGOS before ScriptDev2 when on the Windows platform.

To update your Database with new Scriptdev2 SQL changes you can either:
a) apply only the changes that were made during that revision by looking in the sql\update folder or (files named rXXX_scriptdev2.sql should be executed on the scriptdev2 db while rXXX_mangos.sql should be executed on your mangos db)
b) reapply "mangos_full_scripts.sql" to your MaNGOS database.
