Installing Trinity Core is fairly simple on a Linux machine, assuming
you have all required applications

The most important ones are:

	* make
	* automake
	* autoconf
	* gcc

After that, you can simply run these commands:

	* autoreconf --install --force
	* ./configure

The configure script will tell you if you miss any libraries, and
if so, which ones. You can then download them from your preferred
package provider (apt-get, emerge, yum, and the alikes).

When you have all required packages, be sure to properly configure
your build of Trinity Core:

	* ./configure --help

That command will tell you which config options are available. For
the most part, the following should be used:

	* --enable-cli
	* --enable-ra
	* --with-mysql
	* --prefix=/home/trinitycore
	* --datadir=/home/trinitycore/dat
	* --sysconfdir=/home/trinitycore/etc

Of course, replace the paths in prefix, datadir, and sysconfdir
with the directories you wish to install Trinity Core to. The
datadir is where maps, DBCs, and SQLs are stored. The sysconfdir
is where configuration files are stored.

When you've configured your build, simply run:

	* make

And finally, to install Trinity Core:

	* make install

Done! Trinity Core should now be installed. Now you will need to
apply database updates where necessary. Furthermore, you must
configure your installation by editing the config files in the
sysconfdir.
