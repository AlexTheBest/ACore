== Database Updates ==
This folder contains SQL files which will apply required updates to your MySQL
database, whenever the MaNGOS database structure has been changed or extended.

To see if you need an update, the file names have been given a fixed structure
that should enable you to see if you need an update or not.

=== File name descriptin ===
File names are divided into two parts. First part is the revision that will be 
compatible with database after apply update. The second part of the name, 
is the table that needs and update or has been added. See an example below:

         1123_characters_character_spell.sql
         |    |          |
         |    |          |
         |    |          The table character_spell
         |    |          will need an update.
         |    |
         |    Name of affected DB (default recommended name)
         |    Can be: characters, mangos, realmd
         |

         After appling this update DB compatiable with revision 1122
         will be compatibale with revision 1123.
         Revision 1123 and any revision after 1123, e.g. 1124 or 1137,
         already includes this update in the default database
         file mangos.sql.
